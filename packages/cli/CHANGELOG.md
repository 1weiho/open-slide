# @open-slide/cli

## 1.0.4

### Patch Changes

- 05fb7ca: Make the `create-slide` skill propose aesthetic options tailored to the deck's topic instead of a fixed preset list. Step 2 now requires gathering the topic first and brainstorming three concrete, distinct visual directions for that topic (vibe + palette/typography/motif), so users can actually picture each choice.
- 2f84f47: Add `vite` to the scaffolded template's `devDependencies` so projects created via `open-slide init` are auto-detected as Vite projects on Vercel. Vercel's framework detector regex-matches `"vite"` in `package.json` dependencies, and previously the template only declared `@open-slide/core`, leaving vite transitive and undetected. The existing `build` script (`open-slide build`) and `dist` output directory already match Vercel's Vite preset defaults.

## 1.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 802fd51: Add the required `radius` field to the `slide-authoring` skill's starter template. Without it, slides scaffolded from the template fail TypeScript because `DesignSystem` requires `radius: number`.

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 39780b1: Flatten `DesignSystem.radius` from `{ md: number }` to `number`. CSS var renamed `--osd-radius-md` → `--osd-radius`; `DesignRadius` type removed.

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 8333608: `create-slide` and `slide-authoring` skills now default new slides to a top-level `export const design: DesignSystem = { … }` consumed via `var(--osd-X)`, so a freshly generated slide is tweakable from the Design panel without extra prompting. The local `palette` constants pattern remains as the explicit fallback for one-off slides whose palette is intentionally locked. The starter template and self-review checklist are updated to match.
